// You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

// An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

// Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

// The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
// There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
// 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
// 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
